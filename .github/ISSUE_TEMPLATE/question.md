If you have a specific question, for example on installation guidance or ZOO-Project development, you can ask this below. It is probably easier/quicker to ask on the ZOO-Project IRC Channel: https://web.libera.chat/#zoo-project, an interactive channel where ZOO-Project developers and users gather. You can also use the [ZOO-Discuss mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/zoo-discuss).
